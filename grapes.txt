Grapes are a nutritious fruit with a long history, having been cultivated since at
least 6000 B.C. and widely consumed across cultures, including traditions like the
Spanish "twelve grapes of luck" on New Year's Eve. They are available in
three main colors—green, red, and black—and are primarily grown in California,
which produces over 99% of the commercially grown table grapes in the United States.
Grapes are considered berries, with an average of 100 berries per bunch,
and are available from May through January.
